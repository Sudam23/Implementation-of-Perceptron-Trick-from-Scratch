# 🧠 Perceptron Trick Algorithm

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements the **Perceptron Trick Algorithm**, which processes two different classes of data points as input from keyboard which are linearly separable to perform specific computations. It demonstrates how multiple inputs can be analyzed and transformed into meaningful insights.

## 🔍 Features
- Accepts two distinct data inputs.
- Uses a **perceptron-based approach** to classify linearly separable data.
- Outputs meaningful results based on the provided input values.
- Designed for flexibility and easy modifications.
